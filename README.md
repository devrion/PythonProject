# PythonProject
My final Python Project analyzing data
The data that I analyzed was Air Quality Data from the city of Louisville using the file aqidaily2009.csv
I went to the https://louisvilleky.gov/government/air-pollution-control-district/services/check-air-quality-louisville and got data from 2009 to 2018 to see if the air quality has changed any.
